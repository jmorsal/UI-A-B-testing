# UI A/B testing
Analysis of the results for an A/B testing for a bank website

# Summary

This project consists of the comparative analysis of a bank's old and new UI. This includes exploratory analysis, A/B testing and visualizations.  

## Exploratory analysis
The EDA includes: distribution analysis for each relevant variable, heat maps to explore possible correlations and in-depth analysis of the age and tenure groups. 

## Test and control group analysis
Here we checked whether both (experimental and control) groups are equivalent regarding their age, gender, number of calls to tech service, etc.

## Completion rate
Explored the proportion of participants that completed the process in total and per group.

## Mistakes assessment
To check which UI was better we explored the times one user transited from a step to a previous one. This was done via graphics and statistical analysis (Proportion test, chi square, ANOVA).

## Duration of the process analysis
Another way to compare the UIs was to assess the time spent on each step (Mannâ€“Whitney U).

## Additional analysis
Additionally, using several analysis techniques we explored questions such as the relationship of calling to IT and completing the process

## Tools
Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, numpy.
